# WordCloud
- Generates a wordcloud whose contents as well as outline template can be changed as per the userâ€™s preferences.
- Made with python. Wordcloud module has been used.

*The current code uses the sample.txt and ballerina.jpg files to create the wordcloud so make sure you have them downloaded before you run it; or change the code to run files you already have. You'll get all the help you need to redesign the wordcloud in the code itself.*
